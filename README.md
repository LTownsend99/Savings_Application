# Savings App for Young People


## Getting Started

Before you run the app ensure the database and springboot application are both 
running successfully.

Using a virtual device select Medium Phone API 35 and 
start the device prior to running main.dart

Also ensure the URL to the springboot application is correct on all controller classes

If this is not correct, calls via both services will not be able to be made.

```
  var url = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/account/";
```
Here is the variable that may need to be changed.

## Running the project

To run the project use main.dart
